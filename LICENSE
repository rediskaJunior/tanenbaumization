The Imperial License of Terrifying Suffering and Eternal War (ILTSW) v666.0

Permissions:
By using this software, you have sworn your eternal loyalty to the God-Emperor of Mankind, and you may:

Use: You may use this software for any purpose, as long as it doesn’t accidentally summon the Chaos Gods, awaken a Necron Tomb World, or cause the galaxy to plunge into yet another Horus Heresy.
Modify: Modify this software in any way you see fit, but be warned, any attempt to do so could potentially unleash the Machine Spirits within your device and bring about terrible consequences like a Blackstone Fortress appearing at your front door.
Share: Distribute this software in the darkest corners of the galaxy, but be aware that the Adeptus Mechanicus might track you down if you use anything other than approved binary formats.
Restrictions:
- No Summoning Chaos: DO NOT use this software to open portals to the Warp or invoke the powers of the Chaos Gods (Nurgle, Khorne, Tzeentch, or Slaanesh). If this software inadvertently leads to the creation of a new Chaos Space Marine Legion, you are solely responsible for its eventual destruction at the hands of the Imperium.
- No xenos alliances: Under no circumstances may you use this software to form any alliances with the Xenos: Orks, Eldar, Tyranids, or worse, the Necrons. These entities are unspeakably dangerous and cannot be trusted. Violators will be hunted down by the Inquisition.
- No Lorgar-style Heresy: If you plan on using this software to start a new religion or cult that challenges the will of the Emperor, prepare for a Galactic Crusade against your heretical ideas. If you somehow manage to attract the attention of a Thousand Sons sorcerer, we won’t be held accountable when the Imperial Fists show up to purify your code with fire.
- No Psyker Problems: If you accidentally awaken a psyker or cause a warp rift, you must immediately consult the Black Templars for purging assistance. The Warp is not a toy.
Warranty Disclaimer:
This software is provided “as is”, in a state of perpetual ruin and war. There are no guarantees, except the certainty that it will either:

Crack open the reality and let forth unspeakable horrors (be prepared for the Horrors of the Warp), or
Cause your system to implode under the weight of its own crashed code, potentially ripping open a hole in spacetime that will only be sealed by a Daemon Prince’s cold embrace.
Should you choose to continue using this software, you do so at your own risk. Any attempt to remove it may result in abduction by Genestealers or your device being converted into an Aeldari Webway portal.

Liability:
You cannot hold us responsible for:

Any lost souls dragged into the Warp or stolen by the Dark Eldar during your use of this software.
The death of your entire family due to an Ork WAAAGH!, a Tyranid invasion, or a crisis involving the Adeptus Astartes.
Any permanent insanity resulting from encounters with Daemons of Tzeentch or C'tan worshippers. Once your mind is shattered by the Warp, there is no returning.
If you use this software to create a Titan-class war machine, Dreadnought, or similar war engine, you must be prepared to answer to the Imperial Guard’s extensive paperwork before firing its first shot.

Attribution:
When distributing or using this software, please attribute it to the Holy Emperor of Mankind or anyone who survived the Siege of Terra. Failure to do so may result in a purging, or worse, a requisition by the Adeptus Custodes for a personal “interview.”

Also, do not mention this software in the same breath as anything related to the Great Work of the Dark Mechanicum. You wouldn’t want to inadvertently create a Chaos Titan or unleash a Dark Forge World on the unsuspecting populace.

Final Warning:
Remember, the Emperor protects. But you don’t. Your use of this software has likely already damned your soul to an eternity of servitude in the Astronomican, or worse yet, locked you in the servitude of a Techpriest who will make you fix Gellar Fields forever.
